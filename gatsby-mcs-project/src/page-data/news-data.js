        newsText: "Patch Tuesday’s poised for another turn on the karmic wheel. Now’s a good time to check and make sure you’ve told Windows to pause patching. Wait for the crowdsourced beta testing to kick in. Let other folks take one for the team.Every month we see the same pattern: Microsoft releases its Patch Tuesday regimen; the blogosphere flies into a frenzy about security holes that have to be patched right this minute; some patches have bugs; Microsoft fixes many of them in a week or two, warns about others, and stays mum on far too many. Normal Windows users are left in the lurch. On the one hand, you have the threat of imminent malware mayhem. On the other, you have the threat of poorly tested patches. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.",

        newsText: "Here's a short collection of Apple Watch tools and how to use them to be more productive. Apple Watch offers several tools that can help you get things done more efficiently. What follows is a short collection of those tools and how to set them up to be most useful. I use Reminders on my Apple Watch for almost everything – from cooking times to project deadlines to scheduling calls. All it takes is one push on the Digital Crown to summon Siri, and I can then speak the request: “Remind me to attend the group Zoom meeting Friday,” for example, or “Hey Siri, set a timer for two hours,” to help you focus. What’s great about this is that once you set the Reminder, you don’t need to think about it again. The limitation is that you will only receive one reminder notification at the time you set, but you can change this on your iPhone.",

        newsText: "Every time Google updates its browser, it publishes release notes aimed at enterprises to highlight upcoming additions, substitutions, enhancements and modifications. Here's some of what's coming. Chrome looms over the browser landscape like a leviathan. With more than 70% of the world's browser user share – a measure of browser activity calculated by analytics company Net Applications – Google's Chrome has crushed the competition. Rivals, from Microsoft's Edge to Mozilla's Firefox, survive on single-digit shares that seem liable to evaporate on short notice. ",

I ask her to restart her computer. She does. The problem persists.” So fish starts trying to determine whether the problem is with all network functions, or only some. Can she use the web? “No,” user says. OK, can you send or receive email? “Oh, yes, no problems there,” she says.",

        newsText: "A Microsoft Surface Duo tied to an Azure back end running a cloud desktop solution like Workspot could be the start of something big. Last week, I had an interesting chat with Israel Sumano, senior director of infrastruture services at Southland Industries. He has around 450 engineers using Workspot's cloud desktop solution running on Microsoft Azure. Most of these people are using old desktops, but he has been using an S20 Ultra to host his desktop. That's why I wanted to talk to him. I know a bit about Workstation users: they demand – and typically get – the hardware they want, and Workstations tend to be several times more expensive than PCs. So the idea of putting a firm’s engineering staff onto what amounts to a thin-client solution shouldn’t work. But the plan is to put these engineers on Microsoft’s new Duo, which is the first Smartphone in some time (other than a BlackBerry) with a serious business focus. ",

        newsText: "Here's what you need to know about each update to the current version of Windows 10 as it's released from Microsoft. Now updated for KB4571744, released Sep. 3, 2020. The launch of a major Windows 10 update isn’t the end of a process — it’s really just the beginning. As soon as one of Microsoft’s twice-yearly feature updates is released, the company quickly gets to work on improving it by fixing bugs, releasing security patches, and occasionally adding new features. Here we’ve summarized what you need to know about every Windows 10 update being released to the public. First come updates to the latest version of Windows 10 — version 2004, known as the May 2020 Update — with the most recent updates on top. (Note that Microsoft has not yet begun actively pushing 2004 to users. You can seek out and install the release on your PC, but why rush things? In fact, we recommend keeping 2004 off your machine for now to avoid any bugs that may crop up with the new release.) Next come updates to version 1909, known as the November 2019 Update; version 1903, the May 2019 Update; version 1809, the October 2018 Update; version 1803, the April 2018 Update; version 1709, the Fall Creators Update; and finally version 1703, the Creators Update. For each build, we’ve included the date of its initial release and a link to Microsoft’s announcement about it.",

        newsText: "Chrome OS is getting a super-Googley new superpower — and if we're lucky, Android might soon follow suit. Google's Chrome OS platform is a lot of different things. It's a simple place for web-centric computing. It's a natural extension of Android and the future of the Android tablet. It's a place to run Linux apps — and soon, if you're in the right enterprise environment, a place to run Windows apps, too (!). It's something that's been shaping up subtly for a while but that Google is now openly promoting and pushing forward, and it's an asset so obvious-seeming, it's almost shocking that it hasn't been tapped into 'til now. It's the Chromebook's role as the ultimate Google machine — a single device where Google's services and search prowess come together in a singularly streamlined way. And if you think it's no big deal, well, you're missing the bigger picture.",
